### Caution: Just for fun!!<br/>

Will be fixed in the next release! :p :p 

### Game Rules:<br/>
Connect Four (also known as Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row, Four in a Line, Drop Four, and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union) is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves. Reference: Wikipedia- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four <br/>
